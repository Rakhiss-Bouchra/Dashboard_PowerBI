## Development of a dashboard for visualizing and analyzing road accident trends and patterns in New York.



The database I worked with is an extensive source of information on road accidents in New York City. It contains data on road accidents reported to the New York City Police Department from July 2012 to the present day, and it is updated daily. The purpose of this visualization is to comprehend the trends and patterns of road accidents in New York, uncover patterns not readily apparent in raw data, and identify high-risk areas or the factors that contribute most to road accidents.
